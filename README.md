`binport` is a tool for building lean4 `.olean` files from lean3 `.tlean` files.

# Status

This project will likely be incorporated into `mathport`, a nascent tool that will combine syntactic porting with binary porting, and attempt to produce lean4 `.lean` files from lean3 `.lean` files. The binported-terms will be used to refine ported syntax that cannot reelaborate.
